# Buttons

Publishers can use this component to provide a visual representation of context, it inherits and extends the [Bootstrap image utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#images).

## Button tags

Use the button classes on an `<a>`, `<button>`, or `<input>` element.
For more details please refer to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#buttons-tags).

## Options and States

### Options

Use any of the available button classes to quickly create a styled button.
The SWE leverages the button component from Bootstrap, with the addition of the `Secondary` button.

Publishers may choose between dark and light Outline button according to the background colour, light version by using class `.btn-outline-light` and dark version by using class `.btn-outline-dark`

### States

For **active** state, there's no need to add `:active`/ as it's a pseudo-class, but if you need to force the same appearance, go ahead and add `.active`.

For **disabled** state, add the `disabled` attribute to `<button>` buttons or add the `.disabled` class to `<a>` buttons.

For **focus** state, there's no need to add `:focus`/ as it's a pseudo-class, but if you need to force the same appearance, go ahead and add `.focus`.

Create block level buttons—those that span the full width of a parent— by adding `.btn-block`.
